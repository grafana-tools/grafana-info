# [WIP] grafana-info

*It is just draft with basic functions.*

Displays on the terminal a brief info about Grafana objects.
It can be useful when you have a lot of backups from Grafana in JSON-files.
Utility will help you find for example a right dashboard by tag or panel name.

Planned features:

* treats input as JSON and parse it for Grafana objects
* recognize dashboards, datasources, users
* get a bunch objects at once (from files or stdin)
* show brief info about each succesfully parsed object
* output important fields in key=value format to the output (for easy grepping)

Usage example:

    $ grafana-info < myfile.json

Example output:

    === Dashboard <175980> "Example API" ===
	Tags: [autogenerated] [example] [dev]
	Templating Vars: [env] [database] [datasource] 
	--- Row New row ---
		| MAX DB response time || Max per handler time |
	--- Row Information By Hosts ---
		| Handler Max AVG [1min] r || DB Max AVG[1min] resp |
	--- Row Handlers Response Time ---
		| Top handlers response ti || Top handlers response ti || Handler RPS |
	--- Row DB ---
		| DB Top Query Duration | Top Hits Queries count || AVG Response Time by db |

Future usage examples:

    $ grafana-info path/to/backups/*.json
	
	$ for f in *json; do cat $f; done | grafana-info --color
